Title: About


Welcome! 


This is a site by Richard Styron, a field and computational geoscientist 
(geology and geophysics, geochemistry when I have to). I work as an active 
fault specialist for the [GEM Foundation][gem], and run a small (1 person, 
currently) research and consulting firm called [Earth Analysis][ea]. See my 
slightly more [full bio][bio] if interested in me, or my [research page][] if 
interested in that (it's a bit more detailed), or email me at richard dot h dot
styron at gmail. [CV][cv]

This site is a professional site in that it's mostly about the earth and
earth science, particularly research that I am involved in or find interesting,
and other somewhat related topics.

An older version of this site is hosted on wordpress [here][oldsite].
