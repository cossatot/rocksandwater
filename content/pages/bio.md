I'm a displaced Ozarker (currently in Pavia, Italy) who enjoys hills and 
rivers, and associated things. I have a wonderful, extremely intelligent 
[wife][ls] and a wonderful, not-so-intelligent dog, who share my enjoyment of 
hills and rivers.

I'm also pretty into science, and before that overwhelmed my life, I was
pretty into fiction, playing fiddle and mandolin, [riding bikes in ways that 
they're not supposed to be ridden][mc], and other typical young male stuff.

I'm still obsessed with whitewater kayaking, and like to ride bikes in more
point-A-to-point-B scenarios.

I also don't particularly know what more to say about my personal self, 
so I'll stop. Is it weird in the facebook era to find it strange to write 
about one's self to a public that made no request?
