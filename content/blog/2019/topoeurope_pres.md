In May of this year, I was invited to give a keynote address to the TopoEurope
conference, which focused this year on subduction zones and topography.

The conference was excellent, and it was a good opportunity to revisit the topic
of topographic and tectonic interplay, which I have not given the attention it
deserves since I started at GEM.

My presentation is here:

### Abstract

Throughout the Himalaya and Tibet, moderate- to high-elevation strike-slip
faults undergo extensional stepovers where they cross higher topography though
to be pre-existing. Related seismological data have long been explained by an
influential orogen-scale cross-section model where high-elevation normal
faulting and low-elevation thrust faulting result from laterally invariant
horizontal tectonic stress and vertical stress that varies with topography;
however, this model cannot incorporate strike-slip faulting or ~10 km wavelength
topography. Therefore I introduce a 3D elastic model describing the modulation
of fault kinematics by shorterwavelength topographic stress, and show how this
may tightly constrain the tectonic stress field. I then calculate the
topographic stress field on the Western Nepal Fault System, and use topographic
stresses and observed fault kinematics to invert for the tectonic stress field.
The results yield a maximum tectonic compression of 0–0.2 ρgz and minimum
tectonic compression of -0.1–0.1 ρgz, and reproduce kinematics from normal,
strike-slip and thrust faults and earthquakes in and around western Nepal,
including the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. This demonstrates that where vertical and
a horizontal principal stress are near equal, 1-10 km scale variations in
topography can change fault kinematics, and that pre-existing topography can
influence the location of subsequent faults and stepovers.
