As I've gotten more involved with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA)
at the GEM Foundation, it's become clear to me that there is a bit of a mismatch
between how PSHA is handled versus how many fault geologists and seismologists
on the research side of things view 

First, a couple of caveats:

1. PSHA does seem to work reasonably well, and it's not obvious that fixing
   these issues will result in substantially different results than we are
   currently seeing in many well-modeled locations.

2. I, like many researchers past their student years, have a tendency to
   conflate what *I* don't know as an individual with what *we* don't know as a
   scientific body or community. Someone may 'know' these things, and certainly
   most of topics will have a diversity of scientific opinion; there may be a
   general consensus that I, personally, am not aware of or am skeptical of.

And as a caveat to the caveats: Many researchers have mental maps of the
territory that involve somewhat weakly-held but infrequently-questioned and
often enabling opinions about these topics. It's not until one is forced to make
these opinions explicit when making models that things start to get questioned.
Similarly, many practitioners aren't always aware of what assumptions are
scientifically questionable.

(An *enabling opinion* or *enabling assumption* is an opinion or assumption that
opens up a path forward, in cases where it might not be feasible to move forward
without the holding them. Much of PSHA is based on enabling assumptions.)
