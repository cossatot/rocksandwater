One of the more counter-intuitive aspects of earthquake statistics, as least as 
typically practiced in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), is that 
moderate seismicity will be less frequent on one large fault than on two 
smaller faults whose moment accumulation rates sum to the same as the large 
fault.

The reason for this is that the maximum magnitude of earthquakes on a given 
fault is generally considered to be a function of the seismogenic area of a 
fault. Given a fixed moment accumulation (and therefore release) rate, as the 
maximum allowable magnitude increases, the share of the moment that is released 
in small and moderate earthquakes decreases. Because the largest events take up 
the lion's share of the total moment, this decrease in the rates of smaller 
magnitudes may be quite substantial.

The worry is that the hazards posed by larger faults which produce much 
stronger earthquakes may be underestimated because of their 
quiescence--particularly when hazard analysis is based on smoothed seismicity 
and paleoseismological records are sparse to nonexistent.

But without quantifying this, it's difficult to know how much of a problem it 
might be. Let's do some basic calculations.

First, we'll start with a basic function for a Gutenberg-Richter
