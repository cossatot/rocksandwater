I am slowly putting together a high-resolution joint geodetic-geologic block 
model as a way of estimating fault slip rates for all faults in a revamped [GEM 
Global Active Fault Database][gafdb]. As of this writing, I have much of North 
America and the Tethyan belt of Asia drafted, and showing various sheens of 
polish, but nothing has yet been peer-reviewed.  

Because this is a very important project to me, and a culmination of work over 
a decade on active fault databases (as well as a return to geodesy, which I 
spent much of 2006-2009 working on but have mostly left since then), I'm making 
a permanent page on this site where the most up-to-date version should be 
available.  [Check it out here!](/global-block-model/)

Expect changes to existing rotation rates and block geometries over the next 
couple of years, in addition to regional updates.  If you have any suggestions 
about anything, please [send me an email](mailto:richard.h.styron@gmail.com).
