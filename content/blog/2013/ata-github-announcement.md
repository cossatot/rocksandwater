Title: Active Tectonics of the Andes (ATA) active fault database now on GitHub

*This post originally appeared on my old blog.*

In order to facilitate collaboration in development of the 
[Active Tectonics of the Andes][ata_post], a database of active faults in
the (northern, for now) Andes, we have hosted it on [GitHub][gh].  The
development version is [here][gh_ata], although the ‘release’ versions will
continue to be posted on the KU HawkDrive, as before.  We have received some
comments about incompleteness of the 1.0 version in certain areas (such as
around Quito, Ecuador), and we used that information to expand the database in
those areas.  The database is now at the 1.1 version, as well.  All New and
Improved!

I would also happily field other requests for improvements in the database both
geological (such as about specific faults or regions) and technical (new file
formats, etc.).  Please, don’t hold back!  This is a free, public, open-source
project and the more minds we have working on it, the better the database will
be.  And as this database improves, so does knowledge of structures responsible
for seismic hazard to communities in South America.
