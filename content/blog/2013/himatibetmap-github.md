**edit 9 June 2013: HimaTibetMap repo on GitHub updated to new address**

I maintain [HimaTibetMap][htm], an open-source database of active faults in the
Indo-Asian collision zone.  While I was in phd school, we hosted the data on
KU’s proprietary HawkDrive system, which performed adequately but wasn’t super
accessible for other things than downloading.  Furthermore, it was not clear if
I would still have access to the site now that I’ve graduated.

So I  have made a [HimaTibetMap][htmgh] page on [GitHub][gh], the new standard
in collaboration websites.  This is where the version I maintain will be.
After discussion with collaborators, I may move the 
[Active Tectonics of the Andes][ata] database there as well.

Ideally, this move will make it easier for others to contribute to the database as well.  So if you have anything to contribute, don’t hold back!
