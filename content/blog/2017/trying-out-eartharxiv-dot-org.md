While physics and mathematics have been using the [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org) 
preprint/e-print repository for decades, we in the earth sciences haven't had 
something similar. The benefits of a widely-used preprint repository are large: 
it should increase the speed at which science is disseminated, reduce the 
stranglehold of journals on paper access, and potentially provide visibility to 
controversial or otherwise avant-garde science that the mainstream 
reviewer/editor pool isn't ready for. The drawbacks are mainly that the work 
isn't always peer-reviewed, so it's possible that mortally flawed research will 
get out to readers that aren't willing or able to thoroughly vet the work.

Despite the potential for leakage of bad science, I think that the benefits 
outweight the costs (which are largely hypothetical) and that most readers of 
the earth science literature are quite capable of evaluating what science is 
worth using and building upon and what's not. Unlike economics, for example, 
geology doesn't have a huge and politically- or idealogically-motivated 
non-professional readership that may non-critically run with a paper's 
conclusions. Economists, it's worth noting, still traffic heavily in white 
papers and preprints despite (or because of?) these possibilities, anyways. 
This probably speaks to the increases in efficiency afforded by using 
preprints.

A group of earth scientists has created the 
[EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org), an earth science preprint service; it 
seems to be part of a larger umbrella organization called the [Center for Open 
Science](https://cos.io) that supports open projects and collaboration through 
services such as this, as well as the [Open Science 
Framework](https://cos.io/our-products/open-science-framework/) which is a 
collection of webapps to facilitate the organization's goals.

I uploaded [a preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/8z9ha) today, for the first 
time. It's a paper that [I blogged](../nepal-topo-stress-fault-kinematics/) a 
few days ago, that didn't quite fit in with *Geology* but will probably go out 
to *Geophysical Research Letters* or *Tectonics* this spring, after I get some 
higher priority papers off my desk. I like the paper, though it could use a 
little polish, and I am happy to have a venue other than this blog to share it.

Big thanks to the EarthArXiv team for making this happen!
