I presented a talk yesterday at the [USGS Earthquake Science Center][esc] in 
Menlo Park, California, on statistical paleoseismology in the Puget Lowland 
region of Washington State. I was a little nervous going into the belly of the 
beast to deliver this talk, with some of the world's experts on statistical 
seismology and paleoseismology, and the collectors of some of the data that I'm 
analyzing, in the audience. But it went well and there was a lot of fantastic 
discussion in one on one meetings afterwards with several scientists. So many 
sharp people there!

### Summary:

The paleoseismic record from crustal faults in the Puget Lowland in western 
Washington State contains ~30 earthquakes that cut the late Pleistocene glacial 
surface. This rich dataset, produced by decades of scientific effort by the 
USGS and collaborators, has dramatic implications for seismic hazard and risk 
in this densely-populated and economically-vital area, and also provides 
insight into earthquake processes and fault interaction in crustal fault 
arrays. However, before the fruits of this labor can be snacked upon, more 
thorough characterization of these paleoearthquakes is necessary. To these 
ends, I present a three-pronged approach of ongoing research into this 
characterization:

1. Magnitude estimation: Paleoseismological techniques measure earthquake 
   displacement at a study site, which is then used in scaling relationships to 
   infer plausible magnitude ranges for each event. However, the fault geometry 
   can add additional constraints to the magnitude as well. By using Bayesian 
   methods that incorporate both rupture length and point displacement, we 
   decrease both the magnitude and the uncertainty in the magnitude estimation 
   for Puget Lowland earthquakes.

2. Earthquake recurrence and survival analysis: The expected time until the 
   next earthquake may depend on the time since the last earthquake, but the 
   form of this dependence is not always obvious. Using the tools of survival 
   analysis (borrowed from biology and engineering), we can calculate the 
   probability of earthquake occurrence in western Washington given the time 
   since the last event based on the statistics of previous events, rather than 
   by assuming a standard statistical model for earthquake recurrence. This 
   empirical technique lets us directly incorporate phenomena such as 
   earthquake triggering and clustering (which are clearly observed in the 
   Puget Lowland) that standard recurrence models cannot.

3. Time-dependent seismic hazard and loss analysis: The paleoearthquake record 
   from the Puget Lowland provides quite strong evidence for earthquake 
   triggering and fault interaction to a degree that invalidates the 
   assumptions of time- and space-independence used in classical PSHA. In 
   particular, records of clustered M7+ events within a few years to decades 
   imply that communities with greatly damaged infrastructure from one event 
   may face successive episodes of strong ground shaking. I present very 
   preliminary work describing how expected seismic hazard and loss within a 
   50-year window may be strongly affected by earthquake clustering, and plans 
   for incorporating cumulative infrastructure damage and repair into PSHA.
