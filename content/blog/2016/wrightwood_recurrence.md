Title: Earthquake recurrence and survival analysis: How long should we wait for an overdue earthquake?

Summary: Earlier this spring, Dr. Tom Jordan of USC and the Southern California Earthquake Center caused a bit of a stir by claiming that the southern San Andreas fault was 'locked, loaded and ready to roll'. This was interpreted by many as meaning that an earthquake on the fault is 'overdue', although it's not clear what 'overdue' means in this scientific context. So what does this mean, and how should we adjust our expectations of when this tardy quake will arrive?
