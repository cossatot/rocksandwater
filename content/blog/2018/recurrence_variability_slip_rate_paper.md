Around the new year, I wrote a quick [blog post][bp] to answer for myself a 
question about how the natural variability in earthquake timing can effect slip 
rate measurements over different timescales. The results from the blog post 
demonstrated that there is a lot of slip rate variability over timescales of 
<5-10 mean earthquake recurrence intervals, but that this progressively 
decreases and becomes very slight at >20 mean earthquake recurrence intervals.

I wrote a short paper on the topic this spring, and submitted it to [Solid 
Earth][se]. The paper has a little more analysis, including some heuristics for 
estimating epistemic uncertainty in a slip rate measurement that accounts for 
the natural variability in earthquake timing. The paper is currently in open 
discussion and review at [Solid Earth Discussions][sed]. Please, [find it 
here][paper], download it and comment on it!
