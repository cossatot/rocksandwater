Title: Active Fault Databases for Central America and the Caribbean, and the GEM Global Active Fault DB

Last week I was fortunate to give a presentation at the [GEM 
Foundations's][gem] [CCARA][ccara] Final Workshop in Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic. The CCARA, or Caribbean and Central American Risk Assessment project, 
is a USAID-funded project to develop a unified seismic hazard, risk, and social 
vulnerability model for the region. Consistent with GEM's work, this is a 
source-to-sink model, in which we developed new fault and earthquake catalogs, 
then made a new seismic hazard model based on this, and piped this in to the 
risk and vulnerability models (which also use new databases for the built 
environment and vulnerable populations developed at GEM with our collaborators 
in the region).

My role in this was to develop an active fault database for the region. I've 
written about this [nearly a year ago][ccara-blog], but the 
[database][ccara-db] has seen a bit of improvement since then, and a paper 
presenting it is in review with *Geosphere*. The talk also briefly mentions the 
[GEM Global Active Faults Database][gem-gaf-db], which is my main project at 
GEM and is coming together nicely.

The slides for the presentation are here:

These regional projects we've been doing at GEM have been very good for 
updating regional seismic hazard models, with higher resolution, better data 
and better modeling strategies. They're also turning into springboards to allow 
more local governements or other stakeholders, such as the geologic surveys of 
individual nations, to work with us to build even higher-resolution national 
models. This allows us all to really focus on data and model resolution, and to 
work closely with the stakeholders to have the results to guide updating 
building codes, identifying particularly vulnerable populations and 
infrastructure, and making a base for city- or site-specific work such as power 
plants or hospitals.

With seismic hazard and risk, the nature of the game changes somewhat as the 
resolution changes--the regional tectonics and so forth become less important, 
the geometry of individual faults becomes more important, as do the particular 
site conditions (the type of soil, etc.) and the layouts of the cities, 
neighborhoods and other critical infrastructure. The computational strategies 
in the modeling can change as well. Changing the scale of the work is 
challenging and exciting, and I'm looking forward to doing some 
higher-resolution geology in the future.

Thanks to USAID for funding this important work, and to our colleagues at 
ONESVIE and elsewhere throughout the region for being great collaborators and 
hosts!
