Today’s [M8.6 strike-slip earthquake][sm] off the Sumatran coast is an
incredible event for a number of reasons:  First, it’s (as far as I’m aware)
the largest recorded strike-slip earthquake.  Second, it’s an intraplate
earthquake–although it is about a hundred kilometers from the Sumatran
subduction zone, where the [catastrophic 2004 M9.1 earthquake][91] occured),
it’s not a plate boundary rupture. However, the stresses resulting from
incipient subduction or the effects of the 2004 event likely loaded the fault
responsible for this event.  This may also make it the largest reported
intraplate earthquake, but I’ll have to check on this. And third, with a
centroid depth of 22 km, this is a dominantly mantle event, as the crustal
thickness in mature oceanic plates is typically ~7 km.  Since the energy
released from an earthquake scales not simply with the along-strike length of
the rupture but the total fault area, it’s possible that the great magnitude of
this event is a result of a very broad vertical, as well as horizontal, rupture
patch.  Additionally, the magnitude scales with the strength of the rock
surrounding the fault, and cold (and hence capable of brittle failure) oceanic
mantle is made of peridotite and very strong.  Although I have no idea what
kind of surface observations are possible for this event, we may find that much
of the slip and energy released occurred in the upper mantle.

Well I have to board a plane, so I will cut this off here.  Expect to hear much
more about this event in the future, surely from Austin Elliott at
[The Trembling Earth][te] if no one else.
