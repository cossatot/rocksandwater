figures are shown here unedited, though my thoughts have evolved a bit.*

Here is a summary of the first paper of my dissertation, which has been
accepted to Geosphere (all figures are slightly modified from that manuscript):

Although the Himalayan arc is dominantly a contractile thrust belt, significant
amounts of arc-parallel extension and translation have taken place since the
Miocene.  We (myself, Mike Taylor, Mike Murphy) test the prominent models for
arc-parallel extension and translation, and find that the along-strike
variations in convergence obliquity between India and the Himalaya best
predicts the geologic and GPS geodetic observations.

Over the past 25 years, there has been significant recognition of major, 
active arc-parallel extensional structures in the Himalaya, dominantly the 
Leo Pargil, Gurla Mandhata, Thakkhola, Kung Co, Ama Drime, and Yadong Gulu 
rifts.  Some of these (LP, GM, AD) are the Himalayan/Tibetan version of
metamorphic core complexes (and the differences between these and the 
Cordilleran version will be discussed here in the future); the others are 
major graben cutting the High Himalaya.  The western ones (LP, GM, 
Thakkhola(?)) bear some relationship to the Karakoram Fault, a 
sub-orogen-scale strike-slip fault that accommodates dextral shear between the 
NW Himalaya and the western Tibetan Plateau.  In particular, right slip along 
the KF seems to step south at GM and into the High Himalaya; this 
interpretation (spearheaded by Mike Murphy) has GM being a releasing 
structure on the KF-Humla fault system, and probably accommodating the 
~30 km slip differential between the those faults.  Importantly, offsets 
along the KF decrease systematically from ~150 km in the NW to ~50 km in 
the SE near Mt. Kailash; the Himalaya to the SW is extending, but Tibet to 
the NE is not (in the vicinity of the fault).  This indicates that the KF is 
accommodating differential extension of the Himalaya relative to Tibet.

It is also clear from published GPS data that the convergence direction 
between India and the Himalaya remains pretty consistent, even though the 
strike of the Himalaya changes dramatically (by about a radian) over its 
~2500 km length.  A look at the arc-parallel component of the GPS vectors 
(Eurasia-relative) shows dramatic arc-parallel spreading away from the center 
of the range (suspiciously close to Everest).  This also leads to an increase 
in arc-parallel dextral shear from the central Himalaya to the NW, though 
the picture is complicated by plate boundary changes to the east.  Shortening 
across the range somehow manages to stay pretty consistent along strike, even 
though the magnitude of the velocities involved decreases by a factor of two 
from Everest to the NW.

The major models explaining aspects of Himalayan and Tibetan deformation that 
we tested are radial spreading of south Tibet, variably-oblique convergence 
between India and the Himalaya, oroclinal bending of the Himalaya, and east-
directed, lateral extrusion of a quasi-rigid Tibet.  The only hypothesis not 
rejected by fundamental observations was the variably-oblique convergence 
model, as suggested by McCaffrey and Nabelek (1998). Radial spreading isn’t 
supported by the N-S contraction of the entire Himalaya and Tibet observed 
geodetically, and lack of mapped structures capable of accommodating this 
deformation (the South Tibetan Detachment is cut by the structures 
accommodating arc-parallel extension, and its activity coincided with Main 
Central Thrust activity, so it could not have contributed to an areal increase 
in the Tibetan Plateau).  Active oroclinal bending requires E-W contraction of 
the Himalayan hinterland and S. Tibet and/or left-lateral shear in the western 
Himalaya/S. Tibet and right-lateral shear in the east (flexural folding); the 
opposite shear sense is observed in both cases.  And finally, lateral extrusion 
requires active dextral shear across the whole northern margin of the Himalaya, 
at a fairly good clip, and this is simply not observed east of the KF.

Questions and comments are welcome.  I can send a copy of the manuscript 
although I’m not sure if I’m allowed to put a link to it.
