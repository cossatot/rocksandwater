*This is a post that appeared on my old blog on 20 April 2011.  It is
very slightly modified from that post.*

It’s getting close to summer, and various geologists around me are gearing up
for field campaigns to exotic locations.  Doing this while trying to get the
normal semester’s work done ahead of time is pretty hectic, and there is
a constant danger of forgetting something.  Here is my list of things to
bring for my last Tibetan field campaign; hopefully it’ll be of use to
others.

As a qualifier, this was 2 month field geology trip that involved mapping,
bedrock sampling, and cosmogenic sampling (mostly digging 2 m depth
profiles).  Weather was anything from 40°C (Beijing in July) to -10° C (?
didn’t have a thermometer, although one of these would be sweet; maybe
a little portable weather station?) w/ all forms of wind and precip.  We
camped in the field, but most food preparation was handled by the drivers
while we worked.  It was basically car camping, with big propane stoves and
‘indoor’ cookware, so that is not included in this list in detail.  The
list for more specialized work (e.g., GPS campaigns) is a bit different;
that might be covered in a later post.

If anyone has anything to contribute, that’d be great.  Logistics stuff could
also be good, especially sample shipping, dealing with permits and vehicles,
etc.

if you want)

###first aid kit
- Mine is an Outdoor Research Padded Cell (#4 or 5), holds the following:
- forceps
- water purification tablets
