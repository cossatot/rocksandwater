Title: AGU and SSA have new open access policies

Open access to scientific publications and datasets is very important for
both scientific progress and for the incorporation of scientific knowledge
into the public sphere. The reasons for this are manifold, and have been
enumerated so vociferously on various blogs, email lists, and internet fora
that one fears the spittle will be transmitted electronically to accumulate
on bystanders' keyboards across the world. Therefore, I'll restrain myself
from adding to the ranting here.

Nonetheless, the arguments for open access to scientific products seem to
have been effective, and science is slowly opening up. The American
Geophysical Union (AGU), which is probably the most important geoscientific
society and puts out many top journals (*Journal of Geophysical Research*,
*Tectonics*, *Geophysical Research Letters*, etc.) [has recently announced
an open-access policy][agu], where publications from 1997 to the 24 months
from the present (rolling) are open. This is currently 17-ish years and
counting of pretty great science, and while it'd be a lot cooler if the entire
catalog was open, it's enough that interested parties without institutional
access should be able to get up to speed with current research on most topics
in geoscience.

Additionally, the Seismological Society of America has a (new?) open access
policy that was briefly mentioned in a speech at the 2014 SSA meeting in
Anchorage last week. Unfortunately not a lot of specifics were given, but what
the [SSA's website][ssa] shows is that authors may post copies of their
articles on their own websites simpy by appending a [cover sheet][ssa cover]
to the pdfs. SSA also has open access to SSA members, which I think should be
standard for scientific societies, even if whatever circumstances don't allow
for complete public access. The Geological Society of America has a similar
policy, I believe.
