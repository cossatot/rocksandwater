For the AGU Fall Meeting 2013, we (myself, Eric Hetland, Guohong Zhang)
presented a talk on stresses resulting from high topography and how those
stresses can influence faulting. The presentation focused on the 2008
Wenchuan, China earthquake.  Here is the slideshow:

## The influence of topographic stresses on faulting, emphasizing the 2008 Wenchuan, China earthquake rupture
*Richard Styron, Eric Hetland, Guohong Zhang*

#### Abstract:

The weight of large mountains produces stresses in the crust that locally may
be on the order of tectonic stresses (10-100 MPa). These stresses have
a significant and spatially-variable deviatoric component that may be resolved
as strong normal and shear stresses on range-bounding faults. In areas of high
relief, the shear stress on faults can be comparable to inferred stress drops
in earthquakes, and fault-normal stresses may be greater than 50 MPa, and thus
may potentially influence fault rupture. Additionally, these stresses may be
used to make inferences about the orientation and magnitude of tectonic
stresses, for example by indicating a minimum stress needed to be overcome by
tectonic stress. We are studying these effects in several tectonic
environments, such as the Longmen Shan (China), the Denali fault (Alaska, USA)
and the Wasatch Fault Zone (Utah, USA). We calculate the full topographic
stress tensor field in the crust in a study region by convolution of topography
with Green's functions approximating stresses from a point load on the surface
of an elastic halfspace, using the solution proposed by Liu and Zoback [1992].
The Green's functions are constructed from Boussinesq's solutions for
a vertical point load on an elastic halfspace, as well as Cerruti's solutions
for a horizontal surface point load, accounting for irregular surface boundary
and topographic spreading forces. The stress tensor field is then projected
onto points embedded in the halfspace representing the faults, and the
fault normal and shear stresses at each point are calculated.

Our primary focus has been on the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, as this event
occurred at the base of one of Earth's highest and steepest topographic fronts
and had a complex and well-studied coseismic slip distribution, making it an
ideal case study to evaluate topographic influence on faulting. We calculate
the topographic stresses on the Beichuan and Pengguan faults, and compare the
results to the coseismic slip distribution, considering several published fault
models. These models differ primarily in slip magnitude and planar vs. listric
fault geometry at depth. Preliminary results indicate that topographic stresses
are generally resistive to tectonic deformation, especially above ~10 km depth,
where the faults are steep in all models. Down-dip topographic shear stresses
on the fault are normal sense where the faults dip steeply, and reach 20 MPa on
the fault beneath the Pengguan massif. Reverse-sense shear up to ~15 MPa is
present on gently-dipping thrust flats at depth on listric fault models.
Strike-slip shear stresses are sinistral on the steep, upper portions of faults
but may be dextral on thrust flats. Topographic normal stress on the faults
reaches ~80 MPa on thrust ramps and may be higher on flats. Coseismic slip
magnitude is negatively correlated with topographic normal and down-dip shear
stresses. The spatial patterns of topographic stresses and slip suggest that
topographic stresses have significantly suppressed slip in certain areas: slip
maxima occur in areas of locally lower topographic stresses, while areas of
higher down-dip shear and normal stress show less slip than adjacent regions.
