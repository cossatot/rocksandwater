*This is an IPython Notebook version of a paper I have just submitted to
Geophysical Research Letters. This is the complete paper, but with all the code
embedded, and is executable.  However, it does need a Python module called
[eq_stats.py] as well as some of the typical Python scientific stack. The
notebook can be downloaded from github [here].  I will also probably post the
updated version once it's through review.*
