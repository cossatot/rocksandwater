I've spent quite a bit of time this year working on characterizing the fault 
network for China and the vicinity (Himalaya, Tien Shan and the northwestern 
Pamir). This has involved remapping [HimaTibetMap][htm] and writing a new block 
modeling program to solve for internally-consistent slip rates on all the 
faults in the orogen.  I will write more about that as time permits (or does 
not permit) but for now, please satisfy your desire for dynamic orogenic 
gerrymandering with this movie of Tibetan microplate/block motions from 5 Ma to 
5 million years in the future (the present is halfway through when all the gaps 
  close).  This is based on instantaneous (Quaternary to decadal) Euler poles 
  and may not be accurate paleogeography.  But it's cool!
