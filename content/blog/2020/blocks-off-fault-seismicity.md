I've spent quite a bit of time over the last year drawing blocks (microplates) 
that are partially bounded by faults, to make block models that I can use to 
invert geodetic velocities and geologic slip rate data to get 
internally-consistent slip rates for all faults in a deforming region.

One of the challenges of block modeling (above simple mapping of fault traces) 
is that faults are pretty clearly discontinuous in the crust, and it's 
generally quite ambiguous how they are joined. With most fault-oriented studies 
it's easy to ignore areas without obvious faults, but when you're thinking 
about the continuous strain field in the crust, you can't think of faults just 
ending. *Something* has to happen in between the faults. If the blocks between 
faults are not very rigid, then the strain field may be pretty consistent away 
from the faults. Alternatively, if the blocks are actually fairly rigid, then 
there may be somewhat narrow zones of diffuse deformation that join faults.

There are a couple of different ways of addressing this. One of them is through 
high resolution bedrock (and perhaps Quaternary) geologic mapping, to try to 
estimate the strain of the crust in between known faults. A big issue with this 
approach is that plastic bedrock deformation is cumulative so it may not be 
easy to separate strain from the current deformational regime from earlier 
strain, but this is going to vary regionally quite a bit. However you basically 
get a maximum amount of strain (assuming you can actually quantify anything) 
which may still be quite useful.

A second approach, that might be a bit quicker, is to look at the distribution 
of microseismicity (and likely moderate seismicity as well). If strain away 
from faults is concentrated in fairly narrow bands, there should be more 
seismicity in the bands. Furthermore, if the total strain rates across narrow 
strain zones are comparable to slip rates on the faults they connect (and in a 
block model context, they are) then there should be much more low-magnitude 
seismicity in these zones than around the faults themselves, on average, as 
faults should host larger earthquakes which soak the majority of seismic 
moment, while the diffuse strain zones are probably less likely to have regular 
large-magnitude seismicity and therefore expend much more of the moment on the 
little events.

As always with geology, it's unlikely that all deforming regions will behave 
similarly, so any studies of this will have to proceed on a region by region 
level until broader patterns emerge. It's quite possible that this has been 
addressed in some regions, but I haven't come across the papers. However, now 
that the GEM Global Active Faults database is published, global-scope and 
local-resolution studies should be possible, though a compatible global block 
model would make it quite a bit easier.
